# Stripe-Submenus
Created a clone of the landing page of Stripe.

The most important aspect of learning anything is to simply use the knowledge to create something. It could be anything simple and silly. 
I am currently learning React so this project is an attempt to implement that which I have learned recently in React.

The major focus of the project is the submenu that I have created which is just as similar as the one that appears in the official Stripe website.
Creating that was a huge challenge in itself and I have learned a lot while doing so.
